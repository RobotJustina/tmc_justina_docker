```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

```

After executing the above command, log out then log in again.

Input the following command, then verify that docker can execute correctly.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get remove docker-compose
$ COMPOSE_VERSION=$(wget https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest -O - | grep 'tag_name' | cut -d\" -f4)
$ sudo wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -O /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
